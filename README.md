# Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Modern Application Development I course, focusing on creating a platform that connects Sponsors with Influencers to facilitate product/service advertisements and provide monetary benefits to influencers.

The platform is built using the following frameworks and tools:
- **Flask**: Backend framework for application logic.
- **Jinja2** + **Bootstrap**: For HTML generation and styling.
- **SQLite**: Database for data storage.

The platform supports three roles:
1. **Admin**: Manages users, campaigns, and can flag inappropriate content.
